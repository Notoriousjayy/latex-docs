# latex-docs

A categorized LaTeX document library using `docs/<category>/<document>/` with kebab-case directory naming.

## Repository principles

- Category-first, document-second layout under `docs/`.
- Directory names are normalized to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphen-separated; no spaces).
- Best practice: source-only repository; compiled PDFs and LaTeX build artifacts are not committed.
