rectangle "Performance\n\nCo-location reduces latency\nDistribution prevents contention\nInstance sizing for throughput" as perf #E8F5E9

rectangle "Availability\n\nRedundancy across failure domains\nNo single points of failure\nRapid detection and recovery" as avail #E3F2FD

rectangle "Scalability\n\nStateless for horizontal scaling\nLoad balancing distribution\nElastic infrastructure capacity" as scale #FFF3E0

rectangle "Security\n\nNetwork segmentation\nTrust boundary isolation\nEncryption across boundaries" as sec #FFEBEE

rectangle "Modifiability\n\nDecoupled deployment units\nStandardized patterns\nAutomated pipelines" as mod #F3E5F5

rectangle "Cost\n\nRight-sized resources\nReserved vs on-demand\nOptimized data transfer" as cost #FFF8E1
