actor "AppSec Analyst\n(Ticket Owner)" as Analyst
actor "Developer /\nRepo Owner" as Dev
actor "Seeker Admin / SME" as SME

rectangle "Operational Systems" {
  component "AVIT/EBIT Ticket\nSystem" as Ticketing
  component "Seeker\n(Vulnerability Tracking)" as Seeker
  component "Repo / Component\n(Source code)" as Repo
  database "Evidence\n(Attachments / Notes)" as Evidence
}

Analyst --> Ticketing : Read ticket inputs\n- Project/module\n- Finding ID\n- Short description
Analyst --> Seeker : Search + validate finding\n- status filters\n- versions
Seeker --> Analyst : Finding state\nFalse Positive / Resolved /\nNot found / Ambiguous
Analyst --> Ticketing : Close ticket\n+ standardized justification
Analyst --> Evidence : Record evidence\n- link or screenshot\n- filters/versions\n- timestamp

Dev <-- Ticketing : Receives remediation tasks\n(if not FP / not already resolved)
SME <-- Analyst : Escalation for ambiguity\n- wrong project?\n- access limits?\n- workflow state?

Repo --> Seeker : Scans / data ingestion\n(out of scope for closure SOP)

  |= Element |= Meaning |
  | AVIT/EBIT Ticket | Work item to be closed |
  | Seeker | Validation source for finding state |
  | Evidence | Minimum audit trail for reviewers |
  | Escalation | Used when context is unclear |
endlegend

note bottom of Analyst
Closure is only performed after validation in Seeker
(or exhaustive checks conclude "no longer present").
